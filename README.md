## Contract for the avatars collection: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf586eda308bf91e53abe80d70a50e2f1b6a1143b#code

The Avatar Collection enables anyone to create a unique digital avatar for a fee. Once minted, users can modify the metadata associated with their avatar as needed. The collection was originally developed to facilitate the use of avatars within Twitter Blue, and to provide a convenient way to avoid having to go through the re-verification process.
